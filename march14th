# March 14th entry 
It has been a little while since I last journaled. The last time I journaled was when I was going to Skilstak every Monday. I had issues keeping up with school, father duties and teaching. I plan on returning soon. 
The NCCIA conference was worth while. The coronavirus caused many presentations to be cancelled which limited the overall value of the conference however, I was able to meet some incredible people. 
The content I gathered from my interview with Mark Ciampa inspired me to upload much of the video content that was waisting away on my drive. I am interested in seeing how the global community responds to the videos I have posted. 

# Video Content Ideas 
    - Understanding Hyperconvergence 
        - What is it? 
        - Where does it come from? 
        - Practical examples
        - The value 
    - Practical Subnetting
    - Engaging your IT learners during the Coronavirus
        - Provide examples of remote access tools 
        - Provide examples of cloud based learning environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc...)
        - Creative ways to communicate (Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes)
        - Low bandwidth video content solutions
        - Work with your IT department to allow remote access into a DMZ for students to get access to real equipment 
        - Buy access to NetLabs
