# March 14th entry 
It has been a little while since I last journaled. The last time I journaled was when I was going to Skilstak every Monday. I had issues keeping up with school, father duties and teaching. I plan on returning soon. 
The NCCIA conference was worth while. The coronavirus caused many presentations to be cancelled which limited the overall value of the conference however, I was able to meet some incredible people. 
The content I gathered from my interview with Mark Ciampa inspired me to upload much of the video content that was waisting away on my drive. I am interested in seeing how the global community responds to the videos I have posted. 

# Video Content Ideas 
    - Understanding Hyperconvergence 
        - What is it? 
        - Where does it come from? 
        - Practical examples
        - The value 
    - Practical Subnetting
    - Engaging your IT learners during the Coronavirus (completed this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbnNqoB0iQ0)
        - Provide examples of remote access tools 
        - Provide examples of cloud based learning environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc...)
        - Creative ways to communicate (Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes)
        - Low bandwidth video content solutions
        - Work with your IT department to allow remote access into a DMZ for students to get access to real equipment 
        - Buy access to NetLabs

The Coronavirus is forcing many schools to offer classes fully online. This has prompted me to research options for remote based learning solutions that can allow students to keep working hands on with the technology. 
My Surface Book 2 runs pretty well when capturing recordings however, I do believe it would be good to build a rig for this purpose. I do not have the finances for this right now. Also, I feel the need to continue to share the resources I am finding in an effort to support our students.

Accomplishments: 

    1. Touched base with Kelly Caudle at Stanly CC to build a remote lab offerring for our Cisco students. 
    - With this they will be able to complete lab assignments to solidfy the knowledge they have been gaining in the classroom.
    2. Started dialog with group in defining and improving the online IT learning experience. 
    3. Tweeted at AWS educate to convince them to allow educators to extend the life of their accounts.
